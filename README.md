# GroupMe_bot

The bots can do stuff like:

greet someone when they first enter a group chat
send messages with document or image attachments
mention all the members of a group
and much more!


This program runs multiple bots concurrently. To make encapsulating the bots easier, each bot is its own object with a unique Flask route.
