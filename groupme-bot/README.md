## This program runs chatbots in Groupme. GroupMe API, how to use Heroku, and introduce myself to Git.

The bots can do stuff like:
 - greet someone when they first enter a groupchat
 - send messages with document or image attachments
 - mention all the members of a group
 - and much more!

This program runs multiple bots concurrently. To make encapsulating the bots easier, each bot is its own object with a unique Flask route.
